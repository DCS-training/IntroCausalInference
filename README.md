# A Gentle Introduction to Causal Inference
This is a repository for the "Gentle Introduction to Causal Inference" course provided by Chris Oldnall for the CDCS. You will find resources for Week 1/2 of the sessions in the Week 1 folder (with the Week 2 resources to be released before the second session). The first session will focus on foundational concepts of causal inference, whilst the second session will delve into more advanced concepts and estimation techniques.

Within each week's folder there are 4 files: 'Presentation.pdf' - these are slides for the presentation and Q&A, 'R_Tutorial' and 'Python_Tutorial' - these are the tutorial files that we will work on in Noteable, the content is identical across both and then finally a data file (specific per week).

## Schedule per session

- 14:00 -- 14:10 Introduction and Motivations
- 14:10 -- 14:50 Presentation and Q&A
- 14:50 -- 15:00 10-minute Break
- 15:00 -- 15:45 Practical Session
- 15:45 -- 16:00 Final Wrap-Up

## Practical Session Guidance

For the practical part of the course, you will be needing to work in R or Python. You can choose to work in either or both! Ensure that you have access to Noteable, and then clone the repository as a whole - instructions on how to do this can be found below.

1. Go to https://noteable.edina.ac.uk/login
2. Login with your EASE credentials
3. Select RStudio as a personal notebook server and press start
4. Go to File > New Project> Version Control > Git
5. Copy and Paste this repository URL https://github.com/DCS-training/IntroCausalInference as the Repository URL (The Project directory name will filled in automatically but you can change it if you want your folder in Notable to have a different name).
6. Decide where to locate the folder. By default, it will locate it in your home directory
7. Press Create Project
Congratulations you have now pulled the content of the repository on your Notable server space.
